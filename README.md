# iSH User Setup Script

This repository provides a simple script to create a non-root user with `zsh` as the default shell and elevated privileges using `doas` in the iSH environment. This setup enhances security and usability by avoiding the use of the root account for everyday tasks.

## ðŸ”§ **What This Repository Does**

- **Installs Necessary Packages:** Ensures that `zsh` and `doas` are installed.
- **Creates a New User:** Sets up a new user without a password and assigns `zsh` as their default shell.
- **Configures `doas`:** Grants the new user the ability to execute commands with root privileges without requiring a password.

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start**

To quickly set up your environment, run the following command in your iSH terminal:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stavytskyi/ish-setup/main/setup-user.sh -O setup_user.sh && sh setup_user.sh && rm setup_user.sh
```
